- Data Verification and Cleansing: We check the data for any repeated information to make sure there are no copies of the same thing. We also remove any empty or missing information to clean up the data, making it ready for accurate analysis and visualization.
- Dashboard Development: We create a special display called a dashboard where all our graphs and tables come together. This dashboard lets us interact with the information in a dynamic way, helping us explore and understand the data better.
